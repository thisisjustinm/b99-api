<h2>Quotes API for Brooklyn Nine-Nine</h2>
<p>
    This service provides quotes from the beloved characters of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. This is an unofficial API created for fun.
    <br>
</p>
<h3>Available characters</h3>
<ul>
{% for char in char_list %}
  <li>{{char.title()}}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
Other characters will be added later.
<h3>How to use</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>/name/:name</b> - Use name from the above list to get a random quote from any season. e.g <a href="/name/holt">/name/holt</a></li>
    <li><b>/name/:name?season=:season</b> - Similar as above but with given season. e.g <a href="/name/holt?season=1">/name/holt?season=1</a></li>
    <li><b>/season/:season</b> - Get a random quote from any character for the given season. e.g <a href="/season/1">/season/1</a></li>
    <li><b>/season/:season?name=:name</b> - Similar as above but with given name. e.g <a href="/season/1?name=holt">/season/1?name=holt</a></li>
    <li><b>/title/</b> - Returns a random TITLE OF A SEX TAPE. Link: <a href="/title">/title</a></li>
</ol>
2 and 4 are essentially the same.
