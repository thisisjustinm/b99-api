You can drop your butt! >:|
Your head is so small...Where do you keep your brains?
Hey! Cut it out cake boy!
Your tiny head has a big heart inside of it.
Now at your carrots, or I'll rip your tiny head off!
You have a bad-itude!
School is cool! That's why it rhymes.
I was raised on a disco.
Do you want me to flex and pop off the buttons on my shirt?
When the slippers are filled, Terry is chilled.
