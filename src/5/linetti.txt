Hmm, it just says that no one likes you.
One-duhl plus one-duhl equals tootles!
Floorgasm just came by and danced me out of the group.
I've transcended you now.
I'm writing you out of the will.
My horoscope said to wear a cowl neck today, and I laughed.

Just skooch, you pooch!
You're a terrible hype-man!
I try not to judge. so I wouldn't know.
Do't be rude, prude!
I have either 2 or 4 words for you - Drag Queen or Dim Sum
Is this a make-a-wish thing? Are you dying? Of loneliness?
You should be wailing you stone-cold bitch!
