You can drop your butt! >:|
Your head is so small...Where do you keep your brains?
Hey! Cut it out cake boy!
Your tiny head has a big heart inside of it.
Now at your carrots, or I'll rip your tiny head off!
You have a bad-itude!
School is cool! That's why it rhymes.
I was raised on a disco.
Do you want me to flex and pop off the buttons on my shirt?
When the slippers are filled, Terry is chilled.
MY ASS IS NOT FAT!
I'm just holding a road flare, stepping on some oatmeal!
I had my tuxedo altered to make it tighter like you wanted.
terry's mouth is full of donuts.
You said we could eliminate 'em.
These islanders are delicious.
You have lost the right to pee. You can fidget little man.
Look at all these swag I got...Puffy vest, carabiners!
That's lavender! Terry loves lavender!
