$$, Good to see you. But if you're here. who's guarding Hades?
Huh. From your expression, I would have guessed constipated. Or chilly.
And you sound just like Emmanuel the third.
Hello, $$. You've aged.
So nice of you to greet us, $$, I thought surely you'd still be crushed under that house in Munchkinland.
Yours is an idiot and mine is a fork-tongued lizard witch.
$$! I wondered why all the birds had suddenly stopped singing.
So much time with your head to the pavement. It's a pity a truck hasn't run over your head!
I never thought I'd see you this high without a broom underneath you.
I should be the bigger person. it shouldn't be hard given that $$ is not technically, a person.
I need a witness here in case her head starts spinning around. Or she turns into a she wolf.
$$ is not some invincible succubus. She's a regular succubus.
She's a devil. And you don't dance with the devil because you get burnt. And in $$'s case, she has no rhythm and her hands are like little rat claws.
Well, who wouldn't want to see a man fight a crocodile?
Actually, I was calling you a goat. You goat!
Look, Gina, is that a talking raisin?
Boston? But it's so close to Salem. You do know what they do to witches up there, don't you?
Well done. Now get me $$ and a bucket of water. It's time to melt a witch.
As God said when $$ tried to sneak past the gates into heaven, "It ain't happening, honey."
That's because vampires don't appear on film. Perhaps we should be looking for a 17th-century woodblock print.
What does that human blister want now?
Fine, but on two conditions we stay at least 4 inches apart at all times, and you tuck your tail back into your pants so I don't trip on it.
Maybe $$ wants to inform us all that she's a Cheuksin.
This is some sort of scam. If she were dead, we would be hearing the sounds of children singing in the streets.
Well, I know just the thing to cheer you up. $$ is dead! Bagel! Bagel! Bagel!
Why, in case I run into her family? I'm not planning any trips to the Bronx Zoo.
No way that's true. As $$ says when she sees deodorant, "I'm not buying it."
You must know some moves. You were mentioned by name in the "Monster Mash."
Yes, yours is an idiot, and mine is a fork-tongued lizard witch.
I'd think you'd be used to me slam-dunking in your face.
You've betrayed us, you coffin cave mold beetle!
You move well. Must be all the extra legs, you crab.
No, I meant a human and a rotted jack-o'-lantern.
It's probably $$. Cockroaches release a mucus-like secretion.
The only way I'm going to die is if you touch me with one of your boney fingers and drag me across the river Styx, you reaper.
$$time is over. Boom! Did it. Had it both ways. No regrets.
Hello, $$. You're looking old and sickly.
$$, you sound so naive.
Same old $$. All sizzle, no steak.
